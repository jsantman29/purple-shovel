# Summary

Source code for a school project done as a group of 4. The objective was to design a simple auction website that implemented features described in a provided rubric. 

Class specific information has been left out along with previously used database and web hosting credentials.

# Purpose

This is meant to be an old coding sample and cannot be run locally as it requires a specific MySQL database to be setup. I handled the front and back end code, which included writing the most of the content under the `src` and `web` folders.

I kickstarted the project with a rough MVC standard consisting of classes in `src/objs` and `src/daos` as the Model layer, JSPs in `web` as the View layer, and servlet classes in `src/servlets` as the Controller layer. I then briefly learned about the usage of JSP tag files and introduced them to my group to aid in templating. By dividing up the expertise and filling in the gaps, I was able to improve our group experience.

# Technologies

For the end result, we used an Apache Tomcat web server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance to deploy our application to the web. The front end used HTML/CSS and Javascript, while the back end used Java, JDBC, and JSPs. The AWS EC2 instance also hosted a MySQL Database.
